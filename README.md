# PxDatabases
This repo contains px file based databases that can be used as test data
Please help us add more px file database that we can use as test data. 

## How to contribute

The prefered was to contribute your test data is by a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

We would like your pull request to contain a subfolder to `databases` containing your test data.
Make a good descriptiv name of the subfolder e.g. `SCB Statistical database`.
- Create a `README.md` file at the root of the subfolder and add a description for the test data.
- Create a `db` folder and place the content of the database there. It could be the px files, alias files, .vs files, .agg files etc.
- If you have *.vs* and *.agg* that applys for the whole database the create a directory called aggregations under the subfolder of `databases`and place those files there.
